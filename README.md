This repository contains example assembly code demonstrating two common errors: array out-of-bounds access and writing to an invalid memory address.  The `bug.asm` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with added bounds checks and error handling. These errors are very common in lower-level programming and can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior. Understanding how to prevent them is crucial for writing robust and secure assembly programs.
